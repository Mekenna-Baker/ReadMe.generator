# README Generator

## Description

I created this README generator because I often find myself spending too much time writing my READMEs. With this command line generator, you can answer just a few questions
about your project, and a nice, well structured README will be generated for you! This will ensure that all of your README bases are covered, and no important information will be forgotten. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
